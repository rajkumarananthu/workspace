# PROJECT SHADOW - 26th April 2022.

## NOTE: This is still in planning phase, once SHADOW is available completely, it will be an
## independent git project.

This project is an attempt to create a personal assistant which can take your commands, help in your
research, maintains things for you, if possible possibility of controlling smart home appliances can
also be added.

At an initial stage, this project will help you to create a shopping list.
All the other features will be added as additional features.
Features that are targeted for:
- [ ] [Shoppping List to maintain the list of items.]
- [ ] [Setting a reminder for some actions.]
- [ ] [Scheduling/blocking the calender for events.]
- [ ] [Add CV(Computer Vision) algorithm to detect faces of people.] This can be linked with other
  tasks like "remind me to wake up in 15 mins", and before reminding if the person is already woke
  up, there is no need of the reminder, in this case we can use CV to detect whether a person is
  sleeping or not.
- [ ] [Speech recognition to detect a person and add personalization.]
