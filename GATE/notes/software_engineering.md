### INTRODUCTION
- Challenges in Large Software Projects:
  - Effort intensive
  - High cost
  - Long Development time
  - Changing requirements from users
  - High risk of failure: user acceptance, performance, maintainability etc.,
- Successful software is one which is cost effective, easily maintainable and it is useful,usable and being used.
- Reasons of failure of a software system is due to many reasons like 1) development not completed in time 2) Cost over-runs 3) Not useful 4) Poor Quality 5) maintainability.
- All the above reasons are as a result of Ad-hoc software development (No planning, poor understanding of user requirements, no reviews etc.,).
- In other domains of engineering(Building DAMS, Bridges, Power plants), there are large projects that are completed successfully.
- So as a result **Engineering** is used as a solution to software development, to reduce the failures in delivering a s/w system.
  *To design, develop (build and fabricate) and artifact that meets specifications efficiently, cost effectively ensuring quality.* or *To use scientific principles.*
- Engineering approach(process) applied to software development:
  1) Attempt to estimate cost/effort.
  2) Plan and schedule work.
  3) Involve user in defining requirements.
  4) Identify stages in development.
  5) Define clear milestones so that progress can be measured.
  6) Schedule reviews both for control and quality.
  7) Define deliverables.
  8) Plan extensive testing.
- **Software Process:** A process consist of activities/steps to be carried out in a particular order. A software process deals with technical and management issues for a software project.
  - Software Development (Software Development Life Cycle: SDLC)
  - Project Management
  - Change Management
  - Process to manage all the above processes (ISO/CMM)
- A large company can use multiple software processes to deal with different types of software projects.
- A process consists of different steps. Each step has a well defined objective, specific inputs and defined outputs and also require special skilled people to carry out. Each step has an entry point and an exit point.
- These steps are carried out as per the project plan -> which gives the duration of the project, effort estimation of the project, resources required etc.,
- Each step ends in a review which verifies and validates the step(whether it is successfully completed or not).

- Characteristics of a Good Process:
  - Should be precisely defined - no ambiguity about what is to be done, when, how etc.,
  - Must be predictable with respect to effort, cost, quality.
  - Supports testing and maintainability.
  - Facilitates early detection and removal of defects.
  - Facilitate monitoring and improvement.
- Example SDLC: Waterfall Model, Prototyping model, Iterative model, Spiral Model.
- **Waterfall Model:**
  == Image: representation of waterfall model == 
  - Steps:
    - System Engineering
    - Analysis & Project planning
    - Design
    - Code
    - Testing & Integration
    - Installation & Maintenance
  - Deliverables:
    - Project Planning and feasibility report
    - Requirement Specification (Software Requirement Specification: SRS)
    - System Design Document
    - Test plans and Test reports
    - Source code in executable form
    - Software manuals like user manuals or installation manuals
    - Review reports
  - The cumulative cost/effort distribution increases as we move to the end steps
  - Shortcomings:
    - Requirements may not be clearly known especially for applications not having existing manual counterpart.
      Ex: Railway reservation system: manual system existed, which implies SRS can be specified exactly.
      Ex: Knowledge management for a central bank: no manual system, SRS may not be clear.
    - Requirements change with time during project life cycle itself.
    - Documentation heavy - may not require for all types of projects.
- **Prototyping Model:** when the customer/developer is not sure about requirements/algorithms/efficiency/human-machine interaction.
  == Image: representation of prototyping model ==
  - Steps:
  - Limitations:
    - Customer may want the prototype itself.
    - Developer may continue with the implementation choices made during prototyping.
    - Good tools required to quick development.
    - May increase project cost.
- **Iterative Development:** Where product is defined by many features. Early version with limited features to establish market and get customer feedback. Developed in versions. Each version may follow any model to develop s/w.
   == Image: representation of iterative model ==
- **Spiral Model:** Activities are arranged in a spiral having many cycles, and each cycle has four quadrants.
  == Image: representation of spiral model ==
  - Quadrants:
    - Determine objectives, alternatives and constraints.
    - Evaluate alternatives, identify and handle risks.
    - Develop the s/w.
    - Plan the next step.
- **Project Management process:**
  - Runs in parallel to development process.
  - Project planning
    - Steps:
      - Estimate Cost/Effort.
      - Select development process, define milestones and prepare schedule.
      - Decide on project staffing.
      - Make quality control plans: reviews, inspection and testing strategies
  - Project monitoring and controlling.
    - Critical paths, gnatt charts etc..,
