# Important Points I learned about C++

##### What is the need of references, given we already have pointers, as references are implicit pointers?
- The basic need of adding the concept of references is due to operator overloading.
- As operator overloading cannot be done with pointers as operands(which defeats the whole purpose of overloading overloading and creates ambiguity).
- So this raised the need of references, which acts as implicit pointers.
##### What is Rule of Three/ Rule of Zero/ Rule of Five?
##### What is RAII?
##### What is the need for introducing lambdas in C++, as lambdas are nothing different from functions?
##### We generally declare lambdas using auto type, but what is its actual type?
##### What is a function signature?
##### What is the need to introduce rvalue references?
