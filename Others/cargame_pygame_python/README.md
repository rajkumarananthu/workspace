a car game 

In this a car is moving in a road which is divided into three parts by the markings 
It is a one way road and the car is moving in the opposite direction 
So your duty is to just prevent your car from hitting with the other vehicles from the opposite direction 

the game has been developed but it may have some bugs 
pls tell me if any!!

caution : make sure that you are having python and pygame installed in your system where you are going to run the game file cargame.py

Thank you
