# bumpingball

this is a game that contains tiles at the top. and we have a jumping ball which when lands on the tile at the bottom, again jumps back otherwise the player loses the game.

whenever the jumping ball touches a tile at the top, that tile gets disappeared. in this way the player has to clear all the tiles at the top

when the user clicks start the game gets started.
and when the user want to restart the game, just reload the page.

to move the bottom tile use < and > arrow buttons in the page
