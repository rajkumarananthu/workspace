problems (logical and mathematical) solved

#prob1 description:
In this for a given array of elements we calculate
sum = sigma ((arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k])/(arr[i] * arr[j] * arr[k]))

where 0<= i < j < k <= n-1 and n is the size of the array

#prob2 desription:

takes a string and if the string is palindrome we print "yes" along with even or odd based on whether it is odd palindrome or even palindrome
and we print "no" if it is not palindrome

#prob3 description:

takes a list and sort the list using bubble sort in python

#prob4

implements des algorithm in python

#prob5

DUPLICATION - 
consider a binary strind s with an initial value "0". we expand s by performing the following steps:
1-create a string t where t[i] is compliment of s[i]
2-append t to s
3-repeat 1 and 2 until s length exceeds 1000

given q queries in the form of zero-based index,x,solve each query by printing the charecter at index x in s on a new line
